    <p class="py-2">
        Lightning Creations is a collective of engineers and creatives with a dream to change the
        world. Many of us came together to make games and open source projects. Others came to make
        stories. Yet others just came to try to make the company of the future: one built on
        transparency, not secrets; accountability, not waivers; and trust, not animosity.

    <p class="py-2">
        Our ultimate goal is to build a society where critical thinking, creativity, and
        friendliness thrive, promoting STEAM education, collaboration, and grand ambition. The most
        grand ideas are where the most creativity thrives.
